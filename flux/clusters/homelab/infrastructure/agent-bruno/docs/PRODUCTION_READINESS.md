# Production Readiness Guide

**Last Updated**: October 23, 2025  
**Current Readiness**: üî¥ 3.6/10 (Not Production Ready)  
**Target Readiness**: üü¢ 8.0/10 (Production Ready)  
**Estimated Time**: 8-12 weeks (Option 2 - Secure Production Path)

> **Source**: Consensus from SRE Engineer, QA Engineer, and Pentester reviews

## üö® CRITICAL: Three-Way Consensus Findings

**SRE Engineer (6.5/10)**: ‚≠ê Best-in-class observability, üî¥ CRITICAL data persistence gap  
**QA Engineer (5.5/10)**: ‚ö†Ô∏è 40% test coverage (need 80%+), üî¥ Missing E2E tests  
**Pentester (2.5/10)**: üö® **REJECT FOR DEPLOYMENT** - 9 critical vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.0-10.0)

**ALL THREE AGREE**: 
1. üî¥ **LanceDB EmptyDir = guaranteed data loss** (P0 blocking all three)
2. üî¥ **NO authentication = system completely open** (Pentester: "exploitable in <30 minutes")
3. üî¥ **NO automated testing = unknown stability** (QA: "can't validate changes")

## üö® Top 5 Blocking Issues (Consensus Priority)

| # | Issue | All 3 Agree? | CVSS | Time | Owner |
|---|-------|--------------|------|------|-------|
| 1 | **NO Authentication/Authorization** | ‚úÖ YES | 10.0 | 1 week | Pentester P0 |
| 2 | **Data Loss Risk (EmptyDir)** | ‚úÖ YES | N/A | 5 days | SRE P0 |
| 3 | **Test Coverage <40% (need 80%)** | ‚úÖ YES | N/A | 4 weeks | QA P0 |
| 4 | **NO Encryption (data at rest)** | ‚úÖ YES | 8.7 | 1 week | Pentester P0 |
| 5 | **Prompt Injection Vulnerable** | ‚ö†Ô∏è 2/3 | 8.1 | 3 days | Pentester P0 |

## ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED: Option 2 - Secure Production (8-12 weeks)

**CFO Approved**: $380K with phase-gate approach  
**All Reviewers Consensus**: Security CANNOT be skipped

### Phase 1: Reliability Foundation (Week 1-3) üî¥ P0

**Goal**: Stop data loss, basic monitoring (SRE + QA priorities)

**Week 1** - SRE P0 Blockers:
```bash
[ ] Day 1: LanceDB EmptyDir ‚Üí PVC (StatefulSet migration)
[ ] Day 2-3: Implement automated backups (hourly incremental)
[ ] Day 4: Emergency restore runbook + testing
[ ] Day 5: Test backup/restore procedures (RTO <15min validation)
```

**Week 2** - SRE + QA:
```bash
[ ] Load testing (sustained, spike, stress tests)
[ ] Document capacity baselines and scaling thresholds
[ ] Add disk space monitoring + alerts (>80%, >90%)
[ ] Implement Prometheus capacity alerts
[ ] Create Dockerfile (multi-stage build)
```

**Week 3** - QA P0 Blockers:
```bash
[ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
[ ] Add unit tests (target 60% coverage as first milestone)
[ ] Integration tests (database, API, services)
[ ] Test disaster recovery (all 5 SRE scenarios)
[ ] Incident response runbooks
```

**Exit Criteria** (Go/No-Go Gate):
- ‚úÖ SRE: Data persists across pod restarts (verified)
- ‚úÖ SRE: Backups tested, RTO <15min validated
- ‚úÖ QA: CI/CD running on every PR
- ‚úÖ QA: Test coverage ‚â•60% (path to 80%)

### Phase 2: Security Lockdown (Week 4-6) üî¥ P0 BLOCKING

**Goal**: Fix all CRITICAL vulnerabilities (Pentester P0)

**Week 4** - Authentication (CVSS 10.0):
```bash
[ ] Implement JWT authentication (RS256)
[ ] RBAC enforcement (admin/operator/viewer roles)
[ ] API key authentication for MCP servers
[ ] Token revocation list (Redis)
[ ] Security logging (auth attempts, failures)
```

**Week 5** - Encryption (CVSS 8.7):
```bash
[ ] Enable etcd encryption at rest
[ ] LanceDB PVC with encrypted StorageClass
[ ] Enable Linkerd mTLS (1-hour task)
[ ] NetworkPolicies (default deny-all)
[ ] Redis + RabbitMQ TLS
```

**Week 6** - Input Validation (CVSS 8.1):
```bash
[ ] Prompt injection detection + blocking
[ ] SQL/NoSQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
[ ] XSS output sanitization
[ ] Migrate to Sealed Secrets
[ ] Rotate ALL existing secrets
```

**Exit Criteria** (Go/No-Go Gate):
- ‚úÖ Pentester: Authentication + RBAC working (no open access)
- ‚úÖ Pentester: All data encrypted (at rest + in transit)
- ‚úÖ Pentester: All injection attacks blocked (tested)
- ‚úÖ QA: Security tests added + passing

### Phase 3: Security Hardening (Week 7-9) üü† P1

**Goal**: Advanced security + compliance (Pentester P1)

**Week 7** - Security Operations:
```bash
[ ] Comprehensive audit logging
[ ] Security monitoring dashboard
[ ] Container image scanning (Trivy + Snyk)
[ ] Automated security scanning in CI/CD
[ ] Rate limiting (API + network level)
```

**Week 8** - Additional Protections:
```bash
[ ] DDoS protection configuration
[ ] MFA for admin users
[ ] Advanced prompt injection detection (ML-based)
[ ] CAPTCHA after repeated failures
[ ] Security alerting (PagerDuty/Opsgenie)
```

**Week 9** - Testing + QA:
```bash
[ ] Security tests (SAST/DAST)
[ ] E2E test suite (20+ critical user journeys)
[ ] Performance testing (10K RPS target)
[ ] Chaos engineering experiments
[ ] Test coverage to 80%+
```

- ‚úÖ Pentester: Rate limiting + audit logging operational
- ‚úÖ Pentester: CI/CD security scanning working
- ‚úÖ QA: Test coverage ‚â•80%
- ‚úÖ QA: E2E tests covering critical paths
