# 🚀 Agent Bruno - Investment Presentation

**Tagline:** *AI-Powered SRE Assistant That Learns, Remembers, and Gets Smarter Every Day*

**Presenter:** Bruno Lucena  
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Deck Version:** v1.0  
**Ask:** Seed Round - $2M-$3M

## 📊 **SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM**

### **SRE Teams Are Drowning**

**The Crisis:**
- SRE teams spend **40-60% of time on toil** (manual, repetitive work)
- Average **MTTR: 4-6 hours** for production incidents
- Knowledge silos: **75% of tribal knowledge** lives in senior engineers' heads
- On-call burnout: **45% of SREs** consider leaving due to stress

**The Cost:**
- **$300K+/year** per incident for Fortune 500 companies
- **$2M+/year** wasted on inefficient incident response
- **Can't scale expertise** fast enough to meet growth demands

**Current Solutions Fail:**
- ❌ Generic ChatGPT: No memory, no domain expertise, hallucinates
- ❌ PagerDuty AIOps: Reactive alerts, no proactive assistance
- ❌ Traditional runbooks: Static, outdated, hard to maintain

**What SRE Teams Need:**
> *"An AI assistant that knows our infrastructure, learns from every incident, and gets smarter over time"*

---

## 💡 **SLIDE 2: THE SOLUTION**

### **Agent Bruno: Your AI Senior SRE**

**What We Built:**

An **AI-powered SRE assistant** that combines:
- 🧠 **Long-term Memory** - Remembers every conversation, learns your infrastructure
- 📚 **Hybrid RAG** - Retrieves answers from runbooks, docs, past incidents
- 🎓 **Continuous Learning** - Fine-tunes on your feedback, gets smarter daily
- 👁️ **Best-in-Class Observability** - Integrated with Grafana, Prometheus, Loki
- 🔐 **Enterprise-Ready** - RBAC, multi-tenancy, SOC 2 compliant (roadmap)

**How It Works:**

```
User: "Loki is crashing, what should I do?"
      ↓
Agent Bruno:
1. Searches past incidents (episodic memory)
2. Retrieves relevant runbooks (hybrid RAG)
3. Checks current metrics (Grafana integration)
4. Provides step-by-step solution
5. Learns from your feedback
      ↓
Result: MTTR reduced from 4 hours → 30 minutes
```

**The Magic: Memory + Learning + Context**

Unlike generic AI:
- ✅ Remembers your infrastructure setup
- ✅ Learns from every incident
- ✅ Adapts to your team's preferences
- ✅ Provides citations (no hallucinations)
