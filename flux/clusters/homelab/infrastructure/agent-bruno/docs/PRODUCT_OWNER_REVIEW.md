Effort: Person-months of work
```

**Example Prioritization**:

| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE | Priority |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|------|----------|
| Web UI | 100% | 3 (Massive) | 100% | 3 | **100** | P0 |
| Auth & Security | 100% | 2 (High) | 100% | 2 | **100** | P0 |
| Guided Troubleshooting | 80% | 3 (Massive) | 80% | 4 | **48** | P1 |
| Proactive Alerts | 60% | 2 (High) | 60% | 6 | **12** | P2 |
| Incident Timeline | 70% | 1 (Medium) | 80% | 2 | **28** | P1 |
| Auto Runbooks | 50% | 2 (High) | 50% | 4 | **12.5** | P2 |
| Collaboration | 40% | 1 (Medium) | 70% | 3 | **9.3** | P3 |
