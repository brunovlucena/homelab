### Recommendation
⭐ **APPROVED WITH OPTION 2 (8-12 weeks Secure Production path)**

The system has excellent foundations (observability, architecture) but critical gaps in security and reliability that MUST be fixed before production deployment.

**⚠️ DO NOT CHOOSE OPTION 1** - Deploying with 9 critical security vulnerabilities creates:
- Massive security debt ($80K-$120K to fix later)
- Legal/compliance risks (GDPR violations)
- Reputation damage from inevitable breach
- System exploitable in <30 minutes by low-skilled attacker

**✅ CHOOSE OPTION 2 (8-12 weeks)** - Secure Production path:

**CFO Decision**: ✅ Approved $500K investment using phase-gate approach:
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-3, $50K): Reliability foundation
  - Go/No-Go: Data persistence working + backups tested + RTO <15min validated
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 4-6, $150K): Security lockdown  
  - Go/No-Go: Authentication + encryption + network policies deployed
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 7-9, $100K): Security hardening
  - Go/No-Go: Rate limiting + audit logging + CI/CD scanning operational
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 10-12, $80K): Production deployment
  - Go/No-Go: Penetration test passed + all critical findings resolved

**Expected ROI**: +$360K over 3 years (26% annually)

**Alternative**: Deploy as internal-only tool with Option 1 ($200K investment, $30K/year value, ⚠️ still has security risks)
