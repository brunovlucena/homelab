**[← Back to README](../README.md)** | **[Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)** | **[Testing](TESTING.md)** | **[Learning](LEARNING.md)**

---

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the strategic development plan for Agent Bruno, transforming it from a foundational AI assistant into a production-grade, continuously learning platform. The roadmap is organized into four major phases, each building upon the previous to deliver incremental value while maintaining system reliability.

## 📅 Timeline & Milestones (UPDATED: Consensus from SRE/QA/Pentester)

**⚠️ CRITICAL CHANGE**: Security + Reliability MUST come before ML Infrastructure

| Phase | Duration | Target Completion | Status | Consensus |
|-------|----------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| **Phase 0A: Security & Reliability** | **8-12 weeks** | **IMMEDIATE** | 🔴 **BLOCKING** | All 3 reviewers agree |
| **Phase 0B: Testing & QA** | **4 weeks** | **Parallel w/ 0A** | 🔴 **BLOCKING** | QA + SRE requirement |
| Phase 1: ML Infrastructure | 12-16 weeks | After Phase 0 | ⚪ Deferred | ML Engineer: do after security |
| Phase 2: Intelligence | 10 weeks | Q3 2026 | ⚪ Planned | After ML infra |
| Phase 3: Continuous Learning | 12 weeks | Q4 2026 | ⚪ Planned | After intelligence |
| Phase 4: Production Scale | 8 weeks | Q1 2027 | ⚪ Planned | After learning |

**🚨 ALL THREE REVIEWERS AGREE**:
- **Pentester**: "DO NOT DEPLOY until security fixes complete (9 critical vulnerabilities)"
- **SRE**: "Data loss risk (EmptyDir) blocks everything - fix first"
- **QA**: "40% test coverage too low - need 80%+ before production"

**Old Roadmap Issue**: Tried to build ML infrastructure before fixing security/reliability  
**New Approach**: Security → Reliability → Testing → THEN ML features

## Roadmap Details

### Phase 0A: Security & Reliability Foundation (IMMEDIATE) 🔴 **NEW P0**

**Goal**: Fix critical security vulnerabilities and data persistence issues

**Why This ACTUALLY Must Come First** (Consensus from all 3 reviewers):
