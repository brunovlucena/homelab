## Top 3 Critical Gaps 🔴

### 1. No Implementation (F - 2/10)
```bash
$ tree src/
src/
└── (empty)

$ tree k8s/
k8s/
└── (empty)
```

**Impact**: Cannot deploy the system as described  
**Status**: **This is a design document, not working software**  
**Time to Fix**: 6-12 weeks (source code) + 5 days (manifests)

### 2. Data Persistence Missing (F - 2/10) 🔴 PRODUCTION BLOCKER
```yaml
# Current Implementation:
volumes:
  - name: lancedb-data
    emptyDir: {}  # ⚠️ DATA LOSS ON POD RESTART
```

**Impact**: 
- Pod restart = complete data loss (467 events/year estimated)
- No disaster recovery capability
- Violates RTO <15min / RPO <1hr requirements

**Example Business Impact**:
```
10:00 AM - User has 4-hour conversation about K8s incident
12:00 PM - Agent learns troubleshooting patterns
02:00 PM - Pod restarts (OOMKilled)
02:01 PM - ❌ ALL CONVERSATION HISTORY LOST
02:02 PM - ❌ ALL LEARNED PATTERNS LOST
```

**Time to Fix**: 5 days (see LANCEDB_PERSISTENCE.md)

### 3. Security Not Implemented (F - 2.5/10) 🔴 PRODUCTION BLOCKER

**9 Critical Vulnerabilities**:
1. No authentication/authorization (CVSS 10.0)
2. Insecure secrets management (CVSS 9.1)
3. Unencrypted data at rest (CVSS 8.7)
4. Prompt injection vulnerabilities (CVSS 8.1)
5. SQL/NoSQL injection risk (CVSS 8.0)
6. XSS vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.5)
7. Supply chain vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.3)
8. No network security (CVSS 7.0)
9. Insufficient security logging (CVSS 6.5)

**Compliance Status**:
- ❌ GDPR: Non-compliant
- ❌ SOC 2: Would fail audit
- ❌ ISO 27001: Missing cryptographic controls

**Time to Fix**: 8-12 weeks minimum
