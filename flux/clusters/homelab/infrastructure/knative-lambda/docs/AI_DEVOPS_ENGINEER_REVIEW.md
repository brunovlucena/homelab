### 5. Deployment Strategy (P0)

#### Files to Review
- `deploy/values.yaml` (HPA, resources)
- `deploy/templates/builder.yaml`
- `docs/VERSIONING_STRATEGY.md`
- `VERSION` file

#### What to Check

2. How many replicas do we run in production?
3. What happens during a rolling update?
4. Are health checks testing the right endpoints?
5. Can we do canary deployments? [[memory:N/A - create if needed]]
```

#### Deployment Configuration Review
```yaml
Knative Serving (Auto-scaling):
  minScale: 1                      [ ] Appropriate for workload
  maxScale: 10                     [ ] Tested at max scale
  target: 80                       [ ] Concurrency target tuned
  scaleDownDelay: 15m              [ ] Balance cost vs latency

HPA (if used):
  minReplicas: 1                   [ ] Production minimum
  maxReplicas: 10                  [ ] Capacity tested
  targetCPU: 80                    [ ] Threshold appropriate
  targetMemory: 80                 [ ] Threshold appropriate

Resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 500m                      [ ] Right-sized
    memory: 512Mi                  [ ] Right-sized
  limits:
    cpu: 1000m                     [ ] Prevents noisy neighbor
    memory: 1Gi                    [ ] OOM protection

Health Checks:
  readinessProbe:                  [ ] Tests actual readiness
    initialDelaySeconds: 10        [ ] Enough time to start
    periodSeconds: 5               [ ] Frequent enough
    failureThreshold: 3            [ ] Balanced
  livenessProbe:                   [ ] Tests if alive
    initialDelaySeconds: 30        [ ] After readiness
    periodSeconds: 10              [ ] Not too aggressive
    failureThreshold: 3            [ ] Prevents flapping
```

## 🚨 Critical DevOps Issues

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Review CI/CD pipeline** - Is it complete? [[memory:10004819]]
2. **Test rollback procedure** - Ensure it works
3. **Validate Helm chart** - Run `helm lint`
4. **Check version management** - Automated? [[memory:10004819]]

### High Priority (This Month)
1. **Implement progressive delivery** (canary deployments)
2. **Add automated smoke tests** post-deployment
3. **Set up GitOps workflow** (if not already)
4. **Create deployment runbook**

### Medium Priority (This Quarter)
1. **Add chaos engineering** to CI/CD
2. **Implement blue-green deployments**
3. **Set up preview environments** for PRs
4. **Add performance regression testing**
