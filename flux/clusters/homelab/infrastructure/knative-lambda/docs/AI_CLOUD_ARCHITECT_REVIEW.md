- [ ] **Data Consistency**: Are there consistency guarantees?
- [ ] **Event Ordering**: Does event ordering matter?
- [ ] **Idempotency**: Are operations idempotent?

State Management:
  ✅ Stateless design (pod can die anytime)
  ✅ State stored in Kubernetes API
  ✅ Build artifacts in object storage
  ⚠️  No in-memory caching (consider adding)
  ⚠️  No distributed coordination (do we need it?)
```

Authorization:
  RBAC: ✅ Kubernetes RBAC for API access
  Input Validation: ✅ Implemented in security package
  
Secrets:
  Storage: ✅ Kubernetes Secrets
  Injection: ✅ Environment variables
  Rotation: 🔴 Manual (needs automation)
  
Network:
  Ingress: 🟡 Depends on Knative setup
  Egress: ✅ Controlled via NetworkPolicy
  TLS: 🟡 Configurable
  
Compliance:
  Audit Logging: 🟡 Partial (Kubernetes audit logs)

## 🎨 Design Patterns Analysis

### Currently Used Patterns
```go
✅ Factory Pattern (storage/factory.go)
   - Good abstraction for storage providers
   
✅ Strategy Pattern (implicit in handlers)
   - Different handlers for different event types
   
✅ Dependency Injection (event_handler.go)
   - Clean component composition
   
✅ Builder Pattern (templates)
   - Resource template generation
   
🟡 Repository Pattern (partial)
   - Storage operations could be more abstracted
   
❌ Circuit Breaker Pattern
   - Not implemented (should be for external deps)
   
❌ Saga Pattern
   - Consider for multi-step build process
```

### Recommended Pattern Additions
1. **Circuit Breaker** for S3/MinIO operations
2. **Saga Pattern** for complex build workflows
3. **CQRS** if we add build status queries
4. **Observer Pattern** for build status notifications

---

## 📊 Architecture Quality Metrics

### Code Organization
```bash
# Measure coupling between packages
go-callvis -group pkg,internal .

# Analyze dependencies
go mod graph | grep -v '@'

# Check for circular dependencies
gocyclo -avg .
```

### Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Clean Architecture layers respected
- [ ] Domain logic independent of frameworks
- [ ] Infrastructure details at edges
- [ ] Dependency rule followed (inward dependencies only)

## 🚨 Critical Architecture Issues

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Create architecture diagrams** (missing high-level view)
2. **Document event schemas** (CloudEvents spec)
3. **Define API contracts** and versioning strategy
4. **Review security boundaries** and threat model

### High Priority (This Month)
1. **Add circuit breakers** for external dependencies
2. **Implement build result caching** (performance)
3. **Design multi-region** strategy
4. **Create disaster recovery** plan

### Medium Priority (This Quarter)
1. **Consider message queue** for burst handling
2. **Evaluate CQRS** for build status queries
3. **Design API versioning** strategy
4. **Plan for multi-tenancy** (if needed)
