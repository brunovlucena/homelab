# 🔧 AI SRE Engineer Review - Knative Lambda

## 👤 Reviewer Role
**AI SRE Engineer** - Focus on operational excellence, observability, reliability, and incident response

## 🎯 Primary Focus Areas

### 1. Observability & Monitoring (P0)

#### Files to Review
- `internal/observability/observability.go` (1200 lines) 🔴
- `internal/handler/middleware.go`
- `internal/config/observability.go`
- `deploy/templates/alerts-*.yaml` (13 files)
- `deploy/templates/prometheus-rules.yaml`
- `dashboards/knative-lambda-comprehensive.json`

#### What to Check
- [ ] **Metrics Coverage**: Are all critical paths instrumented?
- [ ] **Metric Cardinality**: Will high-cardinality labels cause issues?
- [ ] **Alert Thresholds**: Are thresholds realistic for production?
- [ ] **Alert Runbooks**: Do all alerts have runbook annotations?
- [ ] **Tracing Integration**: Is distributed tracing properly implemented?
- [ ] **Log Levels**: Are logs at appropriate levels (ERROR vs WARN vs INFO)?
- [ ] **SLO/SLI Definitions**: Are SLOs measurable and realistic?

#### Critical Questions
```markdown
1. What happens when Prometheus is down? Do we have backup telemetry?
2. Are we tracking RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration) for all services?
3. Can we debug a production incident with the current observability?
4. What's the cardinality of our metrics? (run: `promtool check metrics`)
5. Are we collecting exemplars for high-value traces?
```

#### Action Items
- [ ] Review `internal/observability/observability.go` - **SPLIT INTO MULTIPLE FILES**
- [ ] Add CloudEvent metrics to `event_handler.go`
- [ ] Test all Prometheus alerts in staging
- [ ] Validate Grafana dashboard completeness
- [ ] Create alert testing framework
- [ ] Add observability runbook

- `internal/storage/retry.go`
- `internal/storage/timeout.go`
- `internal/handler/event_handler.go`

#### What to Check
- [ ] **Retry Logic**: Are retries implemented correctly? (exponential backoff?)
- [ ] **Circuit Breakers**: Where do we need circuit breakers?
- [ ] **Timeouts**: Are timeouts set appropriately for all operations?

2. What if Kubernetes API is slow (5s+ response time)?
3. Can we handle a Kaniko build that takes 30+ minutes?
4. What if we receive 1000 build events simultaneously?
5. How do we handle partial failures (job created but trigger failed)?
```

#### Action Items
- [ ] Review timeout values across all operations
- [ ] Test retry logic under failure conditions

2. What's the memory footprint under peak load?
3. Are there any O(n²) operations in hot paths?
4. How does performance degrade under high load?

### 4. Incident Response (P1)

#### Files to Review

- `deploy/docs/DIAGNOSTIC_COMMANDS.md`
- All runbooks in `/runbooks/knative-operator/` and `/runbooks/knative-serving/`
- `README.md` troubleshooting section

#### What to Check
- [ ] **Alert Quality**: Are alerts actionable?
- [ ] **Runbook Coverage**: Do all alerts have runbooks?
- [ ] **Diagnostic Tools**: Are diagnostic commands documented?
- [ ] **Escalation Paths**: Who gets paged for what?
- [ ] **MTTR Optimization**: Can we reduce mean time to recovery?
- [ ] **Post-Mortem Templates**: Do we have incident templates?

#### Critical Questions
```markdown
1. If I get paged at 3am, what do I need to know?
2. Can a junior engineer follow the runbooks successfully?
3. What's our target MTTR for critical incidents?
4. Do we have automated remediation for common issues?
5. Are we collecting enough data for post-mortems?
```

#### Action Items
- [ ] Review all alert runbooks
- [ ] Test diagnostic commands
- [ ] Create incident response playbook
- [ ] Add automated remediation where possible
- [ ] Document on-call procedures
- [ ] Create incident severity matrix

2. **Add CloudEvent metrics** to event_handler.go
3. **Test all Prometheus alerts** in staging environment
4. **Create missing observability tests** (currently 0%)

1. **Optimize storage operations** (multipart upload, compression)
2. **Implement chaos engineering** tests
3. **Create SLO dashboard** and alerting
4. **Add performance regression testing**
