# 🧪 Air Cluster - Minimal Test Cluster for Agent-Reasoning
# Minimal components needed to test Agent-Reasoning service
# Based on pro cluster but with only essential components

resources:
  - deploy/01-core-kustomization.yaml
  - deploy/02-observability-kustomization.yaml
  - deploy/03-knative-deps-kustomization.yaml
  # deploy/04-knative-instances is intentionally empty (Knative instances managed elsewhere)
  # - deploy/07-apps-kustomization.yaml  # Commented out temporarily (agent-reasoning disabled)
  # - deploy/09-extra-kustomization.yaml  # Commented out: linkerd-viz and multicluster have kustomize path issues
