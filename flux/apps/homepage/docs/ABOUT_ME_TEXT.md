## Option 1: Story-First Approach (More Personal)

My journey with technology began at the age of 10, when my insatiable curiosity led me to experiment with computers—often breaking MS-DOS and Windows installations in the process. Rather than discourage my explorations, my father recognized this as a learning opportunity and enrolled me in technical courses. This investment quickly paid off, as I not only mastered system repair but also began handling networking installations and assembling machines for his computer school in my hometown. This early hands-on experience laid the foundation for my career in IT infrastructure.

Before starting university, watching "Hackers" and "The Matrix" profoundly influenced my career direction. These films sparked my fascination with the deeper possibilities of technology—the intersection of code, systems, and digital innovation. They crystallized my decision to pursue a career in technology, shaping my path toward working with cutting-edge infrastructure and platforms.

At the end of school and beginning of university, I discovered Ubuntu, which marked my real start in Linux. This discovery opened up a new world of open-source technology, command-line mastery, and system-level understanding that would become fundamental to my work in infrastructure and cloud-native platforms.

My international experience further shaped my professional development. Between 2014 and 2016, I was awarded a scholarship to study at Wilhelms Universität Münster as an international student, where I simultaneously completed internships at small startups in Münster. These experiences provided invaluable exposure to fast-paced startup environments and diverse technical challenges, while expanding my global perspective on technology and innovation.

Today, I'm a Senior IT Engineer with 12+ years of experience designing, building, and scaling mission-critical cloud-native platforms. I'm an expert in the Kubernetes ecosystem, AWS, and modern observability stacks, with a proven track record in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), DevSecOps practices, and leading high-performing infrastructure teams. I specialize in AI/ML infrastructure, LLMOps, AI Agents, and building resilient systems. My passion for automation, Knative serverless, and driving innovation in cloud-native technologies continues to drive my work forward.

## Option 2: Professional-First Approach (More Traditional)

Senior IT Engineer with 12+ years of experience designing, building, and scaling mission-critical cloud-native platforms. My passion for technology started early—at age 10, I began exploring computer systems through hands-on experimentation, learning to repair, network, and assemble machines for a local computer school. Before university, films like "Hackers" and "The Matrix" crystallized my career direction, while discovering Ubuntu at the end of school marked my real start in Linux and open-source technology. From 2014 to 2016, I studied at Wilhelms Universität Münster on scholarship as an international student, while completing internships at small startups in Münster, gaining early exposure to startup culture and international technology markets.

## Option 3: Concise Version (Shorter, Still Professional)

My technology journey began at age 10 when I started experimenting with computers—learning through trial and error, eventually mastering system repair, networking, and hardware assembly for my father's computer school. Before university, watching "Hackers" and "The Matrix" crystallized my career direction, and discovering Ubuntu at the end of school marked my real start in Linux. From 2014-2016, I studied at Wilhelms Universität Münster on scholarship as an international student, while interning at small startups in Münster, gaining valuable experience in fast-paced startup environments. That early hands-on foundation continues to inform my approach to infrastructure engineering.
