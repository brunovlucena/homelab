# 📅 Q2 2025 Goals (Apr - Jun)

## Theme: **Stability & Automation**

Build on Q1 foundation with focus on stability, automated testing, and SLO implementation.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

### 1. Test Coverage Expansion (P0)

**Goal:** Achieve 70% test coverage with automated enforcement

| Target | Q1 End | Q2 Goal |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Unit test coverage | 50% | 70% |
| Integration tests | 30% | 60% |
| K6 load tests | 50% | 80% |
| E2E tests | 20% | 50% |

**Actions:**
- [ ] Implement coverage enforcement (fail < 60%)
- [ ] Add integration test suite
- [ ] Create performance baselines
- [ ] Implement mutation testing

### 2. SLO Implementation (P0)

**Goal:** Define and monitor SLOs for Tier 1 agents

| Component | Availability SLO | Latency SLO |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| knative-lambda-operator | 99.9% | P95 < 5s |
| agent-bruno | 99.5% | P95 < 5s |
| agent-redteam | 99% | P95 < 60s |
| agent-contracts | 99% | P95 < 120s |

**Actions:**
- [ ] Define SLO for each Tier 1 component
- [ ] Implement error budget tracking
- [ ] Create SLO dashboards
- [ ] Set up burn rate alerts

### 3. Security Hardening (P1)

**Goal:** Implement Pod Security Standards and network policies

| Target | Q1 End | Q2 Goal |
|--------|--------|---------|
| High vulns | 5 | 0 |
| Pod Security | None | Restricted |
| Network policies | None | Core services |

**Actions:**
- [ ] Fix all high severity vulnerabilities
- [ ] Implement Pod Security Standards
- [ ] Deploy network policies for namespaces
- [ ] Enable audit logging

### 4. Automated Operations (P1)

**Goal:** Reduce manual operations through automation

| Target | Current | Q2 Goal |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Automated deployments | 50% | 80% |
| Scheduled tests | None | Daily |
| Automated rollbacks | None | Implemented |

**Actions:**
- [ ] Implement GitOps-based auto-deploy
- [ ] Schedule daily K6 smoke tests
- [ ] Create automated rollback triggers
- [ ] Implement canary deployments
