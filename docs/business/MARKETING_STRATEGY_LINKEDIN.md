## Post Formats & Best Practices

### 1. Text Posts (300-500 words)

**Structure**:
- **Hook** (First 2-3 lines - visible without "see more")
- **Value proposition** (Main insight/lesson)
- **Supporting details** (Examples, data, explanations)
- **Question/CTA** (Engage audience)

**Example**:
```
🚀 AI agents aren't just chatbots—they're complete automation systems.

Most businesses think AI automation = chatbots. But we're building something different:

✨ Healthcare agents that reduce documentation time by 60%
✨ Restaurant agents that increase check size by 20%
✨ DevOps agents that cut MTTR by 50%

The secret? Specialized agents trained for specific domains.

Instead of one generic bot trying to do everything, we build:
- Domain-specific knowledge
- Event-driven architecture
- Production-ready infrastructure

Result? Real business outcomes, not just conversation.
