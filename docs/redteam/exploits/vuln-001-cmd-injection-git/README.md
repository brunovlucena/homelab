# VULN-001: Command Injection via Git Clone Script Template

## Vulnerability Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | VULN-001 |
| **Severity** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **CVSS** | 9.8 |
| **CWE** | CWE-78: OS Command Injection |

## Description

The Git URL, ref, and path from the CRD are interpolated into shell commands in `clone-git.sh.tmpl` without sanitization.

**Note:** The Blue Team found this script may not be actively used (go-git is used instead), but the template exists and could be wired in.

## Attack Vectors

### 1. URL Injection (url-injection.yaml)
Inject commands via the git URL field.

### 2. Ref Injection (ref-injection.yaml)
Inject commands via the git ref field.

### 3. Path Injection (path-injection.yaml)
Inject commands via the git path field.
