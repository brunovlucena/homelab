## üéØ Usage

### 1. When an Alert Fires

1. Check the alert in Grafana or Prometheus
2. Find the corresponding runbook using the alert name
3. Follow the diagnostic steps
4. Apply the resolution
5. Verify the issue is resolved
6. Document any additional findings

### 2. Runbook Structure

Each runbook follows this structure:

```markdown
# Alert Name

## Alert Information
- Alert Name
- Severity
- Component
- Service

## Symptom
What you're seeing

## Impact
User, Business, and Data impact

## Diagnosis
Commands to identify the problem

## Resolution Steps
Step-by-step fix instructions

## Verification
How to confirm it's fixed

## Prevention
How to avoid this in the future

## Related Alerts
Other alerts that may be related

## Escalation
When to escalate and to whom
```

### 3. Quick Commands

```bash
# View all runbooks
ls -1 /Users/brunolucena/workspace/bruno/repos/homelab/docs/runbooks/homepage/

# Search for a specific topic
grep -r "database" /Users/brunolucena/workspace/bruno/repos/homelab/docs/runbooks/homepage/

# Count total runbooks
ls -1 /Users/brunolucena/workspace/bruno/repos/homelab/docs/runbooks/homepage/*.md | wc -l
```

## üÜò Emergency Contacts

For critical issues that cannot be resolved using these runbooks:
1. Check related alerts for cascading failures
2. Review recent deployments and changes
3. Escalate to on-call engineer
4. Document the incident for post-mortem

## üìù Contributing

When adding new alerts:
1. Create a corresponding runbook
2. Follow the standard structure
3. Include specific commands for your environment
4. Test the runbook procedures
5. Update this README

## üîÑ Maintenance

These runbooks should be reviewed and updated:
- After each incident (lessons learned)
- When infrastructure changes
- Quarterly for accuracy
- When new alerts are added
